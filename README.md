## 🔍 Overview  
This interactive Streamlit app enables **A/B testing on AI-powered recommendations**, helping businesses determine whether an **AI-driven system outperforms traditional rule-based recommendations**.  

With this **A/B Testing Dashboard**, you can:  
✅ Upload or generate **A/B testing data** dynamically.  
✅ Perform **statistical hypothesis testing** (T-tests & Chi-square tests).  
✅ Visualize key **A/B testing metrics** (CTR, CR, retention, playtime).  
✅ Get **data-driven deployment recommendations** for AI models.

## 🚀 How to Use the A/B Testing App  

### **1️⃣ Access the App**  
Click the link below to open the **A/B Testing Dashboard**:  
🔗 **[Launch A/B Testing Dashboard]((https://a-b-testing-hngdp4retx3vca8mscsrmk.streamlit.app/)**  

### **2️⃣ Upload Your Data (Optional)**  
- Click the **"Upload CSV File"** button in the sidebar.  
- Upload your A/B test dataset.  

### **3️⃣ Generate Sample Data (If No CSV)**  
- If no file is uploaded, the app will generate **sample A/B testing data**.  

### **4️⃣ View Hypothesis Testing Results**  
- The app performs **T-tests & Chi-square tests** to compare **CTR, CR, retention, and playtime** between Group A (rule-based) and Group B (AI-powered).  
- **Significant results (p-value < 0.05) indicate AI-driven recommendations are better**.  

### **5️⃣ Explore Data Visualizations**  
- **Bar charts & histograms** show CTR, conversion rate, retention rate, and playtime distributions.  

### **6️⃣ Get a Final Decision**  
✅ If AI recommendations **significantly improve** key metrics, the app suggests **deploying the AI model**.  
❌ If results are **not significant**, the app suggests further testing or model improvements.
